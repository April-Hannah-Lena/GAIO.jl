# Summary

GAIO (Global Analysis of Invariant Objects) is a software package implementing 
Ulam's method for dynamical systems. GAIO's uses in analysis include isolating 
attractors, discretizing invariant measures and computing their transfer 
behaviors, among others. The algorithms that make up GAIO have been rebuilt 
from the ground up using Julia; the result is a package in which pseudocode 
can be written verbatim and executed with performance beating the Matlab 
implementation.
