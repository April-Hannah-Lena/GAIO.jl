# GAIO - Global Analysis of Invariant Objects
GAIO is a framework establishing the global numerical analysis of Dynamical Systems based on set oriented techniques.

Its core ability is to discretize sets as well as maps, such that when inputting a discretized set into a discretized map, the output will again be a discretized set. 
To that extent, GAIO enables the application of direct operations meant for sets (like `union` and `setdiff` to the images of such discretized maps. 

Thus, it allows the set oriented computation and/or visualization of 
- invariant sets (e.g. periodic points, global attractor, chain recurrent set) of arbitrary dimension or topology
- invariant manifolds (stable/unstable manifolds of an arbitrary invariant set)
- invariant measures, almost invariant sets, coherent sets
