# GAIO - Global Analysis of Invariant Objects
GAIO is a framework establishing the global numerical analysis of Dynamical Systems based on set oriented techniques.

It allows the set oriented computation and/or visualization of 
- invariant sets (e.g. periodic points, global attractor, chain recurrent set) of arbitrary dimension or topology
- invariant manifolds (stable/unstable manifolds of an arbitrary invariant set)
- invariant measures, almost invariant sets, coherent sets


## Installation
Just 
```
using Pkg
Pkg.add("GAIO")
```
from the Julia REPL
