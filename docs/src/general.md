# General usage
The base of the numerical set oriented methods of this framework are `BoxSet` (the discretization of a set) and `BoxMap` (the discretization of a map), thus, in the following, we will have a closer look at the two and other useful things to know when working with GAIO.

## BoxSet

## BoxMap

## The Subdivision Algorithm

## Regular vs. tree partition

## Plots
